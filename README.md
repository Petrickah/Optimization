# Optimization Algorithms for the maximum surface coverage problem

### This project meant to find the most efficient and precised algorithms to maximize the surface coverage of three video cameras placed on ceiling.

Using Python, I've implemented three optimization algorithms to solve this problem. The problem meant to find an optimization algorithm which maximizes the area covered by three ceiling video cameras in a room.

Using Hill Climbing with and without retrace and Simulated Annealing I've discovered that Simulated Annealing was the most useful algorithm. It found the maximum area and positions of the camera in a few minutes on the example instance.

This project took me 2 weeks to complete and obtained a maximum of 10 / 10 for the exam.
